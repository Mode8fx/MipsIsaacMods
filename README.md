# Isaac Mods
This repo contains all of the mods I've made for The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. These were originally made for the Afterbirth+ expansion, but many of them have since been updated to also support Repentance, with full multiplayer support.

All mods are currently available on the Steam Workshop. In the case of music mods, music is not included in this repo.
