    <description>• Active (6 room charge)
• Gives a small, permanent stat boost on every use
• The increased stat is random, but you can give a specific stat priority
• Can give Bookworm transformation
• Repentance and multiplayer support

The Self-Help Book gives a small but permanent stat boost, equal to 1/2 of a stat up pill. The possible stat boosts are:

• Damage +0.25
• Range +1.25
• Speed +0.075
• Luck +0.5
• +1 empty heart container

After using this item, you can fire in a direction to give one stat priority. There is a 50% chance that the chosen stat will increase, and a 12.5% chance for every other stat. Health Up cannot be given priority, so you'll just have to get lucky if you want more health.

This mod has [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1603631350]Mod Config Menu[/url] support! You can change the strength of the stat boost, make it guaranteed that your chosen stat will increase, remove stat priority to make it completely random, or remove health from the pool of stats that can increase.

Two challenges are included, both of which start you with the Self-Help Book and the No! trinket. Depending on which challenge you pick, your goal will be to defeat either The Lamb or ???.
