    <description>• Active (6 room charge)
• Converts passive items/familiars of a low quality into an item of a higher quality
• Repentance and multiplayer support

Loosely based on the Minecraft Tekkit/Equivalent Exchange item of the same name, the Transmutation Tablet allows you to convert lower-quality items into a single higher-quality item. The catch is that you can't pick exactly which items you convert or which new item you get, so don't use it recklessly!

The default costs are:
• 2x 0-quality items -&gt; a 1-quality item
• 2x 1-quality items -&gt; a 2-quality item
• 2x 2-quality items -&gt; a 3-quality item
• 4x 3-quality items -&gt; a 4-quality item
... but these costs can be adjusted between 1 and 6 each using [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2681875787]Mod Config Menu[/url].

Repentogon is recommended but not required; if you don't have it, the item names printed upon conversion will be less human-readable.

[u]Synergies:[/u]
• Car Battery: Two conversions will be performed, if possible.
• Quest items (Polaroid, Key Pieces, etc.): These are ignored; they will not be created or destroyed.</description>
