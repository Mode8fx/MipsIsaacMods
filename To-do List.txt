Note: There's a good chance these remaining issues will never be fixed; all that's left are bugs that are either unfixable (to my knowledge) or simply not worth the trouble.



Unfixable(?) Bugs:

Bump Attack, Chill Out, Close Call
- These items cannot prevent losing Holy Mantle (Holy Mantle activates before the MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG callback is attempted)



Other Known Bugs:

Transformation API
- This mod does not have proper multiplayer support, and Repentance support may be a little dodgy. But Repentance itself added transformation tags to item XMLs and makes this mod completely redundant anyway.

Restock+ and Dark Restock:
- Picking up A Pound of Flesh nullifies the added effect of Restock+ and makes Dark Restock useless.
