Bump Attack
- Bumping into a bumpable enemy still takes away Holy Mantle, etc.
- Only works for player 1
- Affects all players equally (probably keep this behavior? but refine it)

Dark Restock
- "PostUpdate" failed: line 106: attempt to index a nil value (upvalue 'player')
	- Only does this during the first run after the game is opened
- Item currently spawns three random pickups; make this a toggle (disabled by default)
- Only works if player 1 has Dark Restock
- Does not work if A Pound of Flesh is active (should restock devil room item)
- Tainted Jacob's ghost form can get infinite items

Restraining Order
- "PostUpdate" failed: line 136: attempt to index a nil value (upvalue 'player')
	- Only does this during the first run after the game is opened

Paper Isaac (Transformation)
- "PostUpdate" failed: line 246: attempt to index a nil value (upvalue 'p')

- If player 1 gets three Paper items, player 1 gets the costume and stat boost, but all players get the transformation

- Refund
- Restraining Order
- Return Postage
- Self-Help Book

Unfixable(?) Bugs:

Chill Out, Close Call
- These items cannot prevent losing Holy Mantle (Holy Mantle activates before the MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG callback is attempted)

Spike Shield
- Spiked rocks pierce Spike Shield (I don't think there's a way to uniquely distinguish this entity through the damageSource since it's a GridEntity)
