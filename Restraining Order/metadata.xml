• +3 coins, +3 bombs, +3 keys, +3 soul hearts, and +32.5% Angel room chance
• You can no longer enter Devil rooms
• Repentance and multiplayer support

You can now destroy the statue that appears in Devil rooms, and doing so will spawn a Restraining Order in its place. The Restraining Order is an incentive to avoid Devil deals; it gives great rewards, but &quot;bans&quot; you from Devil rooms for the rest of the run. In other words, entering a Devil room immediately teleports you back to the previous room. The Restraining Order won't spawn - and will even despawn - if you take a Devil deal.
