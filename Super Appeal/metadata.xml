• +1 Luck
• Up to +1.5 additional Luck depending on room clear bonus
• Can give Paper Isaac transformation

This item gives a +1 Luck up and an additional 0.1 Luck every time you clear a room. But be careful: taking damage removes 0.3 Luck from this bonus. This per-room bonus maxes out at 1.5 Luck and can't go below 0. In other words, you get a total +1 ~ +2.5 Luck up depending on your room bonus.
