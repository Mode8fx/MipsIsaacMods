    <description>• Passive
• Gives a chance to avoid damage when at low health
• Can give Paper Isaac transformation
• Repentance and multiplayer support

When your total health (red hearts + soul hearts) is 1.5 hearts or less, there is a 1/3 chance you will avoid damage and gain one second of invincibility. This stacks multiplicatively with damage avoiding items such as Infamy, Host Hat, and even itself. Just like in its original games, it can be broken if you manage to get two of them!
