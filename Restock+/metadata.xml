    <description>• Mod of Restock
• Makes Restock also restock Devil rooms and black markets in addition to shops
• Repentance and multiplayer support

Restock+ is a mod of Restock that makes it also restock Devil rooms and black markets. It also restocks items spawned by the Shady Pass.

By default, the Lost/Tainted Lost/Tainted Jacob (ghost) is limited to one Devil room or black market restock/floor to prevent an easy win, but this can be changed with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1603631350]Mod Config Menu[/url] to 0-5 or unlimited restocks/floor.

If you want this ability to be its own item, I also made [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1825506519]Dark Restock[/url], which only restocks Devil rooms, black markets, and Shady Pass items.
