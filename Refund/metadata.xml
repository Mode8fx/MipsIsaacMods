    <description>• Passive
• Using an active item drops money depending on item charge and Luck
• Can give Paper Isaac transformation
• Repentance and multiplayer support

Using an active item spawns money depending on the item's charge and your Luck stat, maxing out at 15 coins total per active item.

You need +2 Luck to spawn pennies at the same rate as the Sack of Pennies (one penny every two rooms), but this works great with good use of battery and charge related items.
